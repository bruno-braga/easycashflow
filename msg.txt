Remove alert to edit or delete by option(current, foward and all)

Every time you needed to delete or edit an expense an alert showing 3
options popped up asking you to choose 'this', 'foward' or 'all'. If you
choose this only the current expense would be delete, foward from the current 
to the last one and all would operate the action in all expenses. This feature
removes the alert pop up and put the options onto the form.
